docker tag aws-ecs:latest 908108847798.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aws-ecs:latest
docker push 908108847798.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aws-ecs:latest

docker tag kiran3011/nginxtest_image1:v1 908108847798.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aws-ecs:latest ( here my image name is ->dashpradeep/nginxtest_image1:v1)
docker push 908108847798.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aws-ecs:latest


docker tag kiran3011/nginxtest_image1:v1 314554362330.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kiran3011:nginx-realease1  ( here registory name is kiran3011)
