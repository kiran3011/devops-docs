click on ok

Go to Build
Select - Execute shell
echo " Hello , This is my first jenkins job"

Enable/Disable Login jenkins
----------------------------

 if we open up an incognito for our browser, we're going to go to open the jenkins URL <http://34.202.160.12:8080/> , and it's going to ask for the user name, a password.

So for now, if someone wants to log in, then that person should have the password.

Login to the jenkins.

Open a new incognito window and open the jenkins URL - http://PublicIP:8080/

Open the jenkins URL in an incognito window , it is asking to login to jenkins again.

To disable the login 

Go to  Manage jenkins -> configure Global security

select the dropdown under Authorization - "Anyone can do anything"

click on save.


Now open a incognito window and open the jenkins URL , it will not ask for the password.

Now it is open to all. Anyone can login to this and access.

This is not a good practice to open  the jenkis for everyone. 

so here under Authorization , our option always should be "Logged-in user can do anything"


Enable the Login again
-----------------------

Go to  Manage jenkins -> configure Global security

 select  radio button under Authorization - Logged-in users can do anything
 
 Do not select the checkbox "Allow anonymous read access"

Now every user need userid and password to access.



Allow user to singup jenkins or create a new account
===================================================

Now you will see an link -> Please sign in below or create an account.


click on create account

username - test and fill all the other details.

and create an account.

Now this new user can do all the activity.

it is not a good practice to provide an option to create an account.

Disallow the other user to open the account

Go to  Manage jenkins -> configure Global security

UseCase - Project-Based Matrix Security
=======================================

you will configure security contexts in Jenkins for your company by creating and applying nested folders and ensuring that users only have access to items in their scope

Step1 - Enable project based matrix security
Step2 - Create user - James , Mary , Laura
   james - Frontend Developer
   Mary - Backend Developer
   Laura - Server Admin

Step3 - Create webdev folder and give James access

Step4 - Create backend folder and give Mary full access

Step5 - create tomcat folder inside the backend folder and give Laura access to this folder

Step6- verify that james is not able to access the backend folder . 
  Mary cannot see the webdev folder but can see tomcat folder and should access the tomcat folder job.
  Laura can access only tomcat folder
  
 Step1
------

Go to Manage jenkins -> Configure Global security  

Enable "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy"  under Authorization

under Overall -> "Authenticated users" - Enable ( Read)
save the changes


 Step2
------
To create a New User

Go to  Manage jenkins 

click on manage user

click on "create user"

username - James , password - 123456 , Fullname - james , Email - james@james.com
username - Mary , password - 123456 , Fullname - Mary , Email - mary@mary.com
username - Laura , password - 123456 , Fullname - Laura , Email - laura@laura.com


Step3
------

click on New Item
Enter "webdev" and select "Folder " option
click on ok

Select "Enable project-based security" checkbox under Properties section 

Inheritance Strategy dropdown  -> Do not inherit permission grant from other ACL

click on Add user Button -> Add James 

select "Grant all permission to James" by enable the checkbox Button at extreme right

select "Grant all permission to Mary" Button at extreme end ( Not Required at this moment)

Click  on save.

create a new Job inside the webdev folder

Select "Enable project-based security"

Inheritance Strategy dropdown  -> Do not inherit permission grant from other ACL

click on Add user Button -> Enter  "Mary"  and click ok

select "Grant all permission to Mary" Button at extreme right

click on save.

Below section we will add later 

--------------------------------------------------
Goto the "backend" folder 
Add user - "laura"  and Read only access to the job ( because laura should see tomcat folder , though she is able to see backend folder but she cannot run any job    under backend folder)
click on save.
--------------------------------------------------

create a new Job inside the backend folder 
job name - backend_test ( Freestyle)

click on save.

Step5

To create a tomcat folder.

Go the backend folder
click on New item
name - tomcat folder and select the folder option
click on on

select "Enable project-based security"

click on Add user Button -> Add Laura 

select "Grant all permission to Laura" Button at extreme right

click on save.

create a new Job inside the tomcat folder 
job name - tomcat-test ( Freestyle)

click on save.


Step - 6
---------
Laura can access only tomcat folder
Mary cannot see the webdev folder but can see tomcat folder and should access the tomcat folder job.
verify that james is not able to access the backend folder . 
  
  
  
Open a incognito window

Login with Laura and verify her access

Now Laura is not able to see any tomcat folder. Now we need to add Laura under backend folder.

Go to jenkins admin user

--------------------------------------------------
Goto the "backend" folder 
Add user - "laura"  and Read only access to the job ( because laura should see tomcat folder , though she is able to see backend folder but she cannot run any job    under backend folder. she should allow to run the job inside tomacat folder)
click on save.
--------------------------------------------------

Login with Laura and verify her access again.

Login with Mary and Verify the access.

Mary should able to see the backend folder and backend job. She also able to see tomcat  folder and tomcat job..


Login with James and Verify the access.
